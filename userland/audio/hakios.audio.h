/*
 * /dev/hakios-audio: the sound iOS plays, on its way to whatever can make it heard.
 *
 * iOS expects its output devices from Apple's audio drivers through IOAudio2; neither exists
 * here. Instead the audio server (mediaserverd) is given a plug-in of ours that presents one
 * stereo output device, and the plug-in writes what the server has mixed for that device
 * here. In the kernel the samples go to a sink -- a driver for something that plays them --
 * and, if asked for, into a recording that outlives the kernel (see dev/hakios.audio.c).
 *
 *   write(): whole frames in the format below. Never blocks: the writer is the audio server's
 *            real-time thread, which paces itself (48000 frames a second while anything
 *            plays, nothing at all otherwise). What the sink cannot take is dropped.
